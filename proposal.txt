An adventure through space where you can visit different places and play games.
Tentatively, can visit the moon, one of Jupiter's moons, Saturn's rings, and Venus
or Mars.
- Jupiter's moon: water rafting through liquid cyanide, tilting your body from 
side to side and jumping to earn points. Must finish the course within a time limit
and without running out of energy. Then you earn a star and have Jupiter complete.
- Moon: playing darts with gravity effects. Again can win/lose based on how many 
points you get for each of your throws. Must add up to at least some minimum for
you to earn the star.
- Saturn's rings: inspired by Rainbow Road, drive a rover along the rings as
little meteors come flying your way that you must avoid and tilt side to side again.
- Mars/Venus: if I have time, bouncy obstacle course where you can jump and grab
onto ledges. Moving parts can hit you and lose energy

I will go about this location by location so that I have one working game done before
the next so that I know it works and don't have to worry about not being able to finish 
all of them.

I have to play the games inside the Kinect visual studios. I will have an instruction
page and then it will take the user to the game on that planet. Like in tkinter,
score/energy will be on the screen always while the visuals change.

The trickiest part is connecting Kinect and Tkinter to work together. I believe I
must code in Visual Studios to continuously intake data, and if this is true,
then the second trickiest part is learning the lingo of the kinect code.

I believe only kinect, pygame by extension, and PIL by extension (may not even be
used).
