Download the Zip file and make sure you keep all the individual files in the same
folder, images, code, and all. Make sure you have the proper programs downloaded
on your laptop to use Kinect: SDK Kinect and Visual Studios. This also requires
the use of Pygame, which should be incorporated in Visual Studios. Then open the file
named 'Vika.py' and on the top of the screen, choose Project --> Run Without 
Debugging. This should automatically pull up the start screen. So that you get the 
best results with the Kinect, place it at hip level (not angled too high or too low)
and stand about 7-9 feet away. Also try to clear the area so that you are free to 
move and make sure there are not other people in the Kinect's view.


My project is a Kinect game that uses the tracking of joints to calculate basic
movements including: raising a hand above your head, squatting, jumping, moving
side to side, and tilting your body (by standing up straight as a stick but moving
your shoulders relative to your spine base/hips. These movements control how the
player on the screen moves around obstacles. You travel the solar system to 3 
different games. One is an obstacle course similar to Mario where you must jump
from platform to platform and avoid or kill moving Monsters on the platforms.
The second is based off of Rainbow Road, in which the player is 'running' down a 
rainbow colored road, avoiding holes in the road and meteors flying at you. Lastly,
there is a game of you going down the river where the player must duck (squat)
underneath UFO's and jump over floating aliens.
